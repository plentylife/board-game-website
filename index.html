              <p>Your life depends on hundreds if not thousands of brands; some you are not even aware of. Yet, how much say do you have?</p>
              <p>For the majority the answer is: from little to none. Big brands that don't operate on Plenty of Thanks principles, don't involve their consumers directly into their business. </p>
